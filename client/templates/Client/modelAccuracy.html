        <b><h4>Interpretation:</h4></b> 
        This shows how stringently the model is flagging candidates as Genuine. 
        <br><br>
        <strong><u><i>Very High Value:</i></u></strong> The model is aggressively marking candidates as Genuine
        and candidates are not getting the benefit of doubt. <strong>Corporate Brand</strong> is
        getting impacted since deserving candidates are walking away with a
        negative experience.
        <br><br>
        <strong><u><i>Very Low Value:</i></u></strong> The model is not effective in identifying Genuine
        candidates and hence they are entering the system. <strong>Client/CustomerRelationships</strong>
        since deliverables are going to get impacted on account of sub-optimal associates. 
        <br><br>
        Whenever the value is Very High / Low please work with your AI Service
        provider to review the model parameters.
